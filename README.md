# Config files for zsh, vim, and more

Automated installation of zsh, oh-mh-zsh, powerlevel10k prompt, anaconda3, and a few plugins for vim and zsh

To install and setup environment:

1. Run the following:
```
git clone git@github.com:rossketron/Dotfiles
cd Dotfiles
bash install.sh
```

2. After the `install.sh` script is done, you will need to open the four 'MesloNF' `.ttf` font files from a file browser and click install.
3. Open your terminal settings and change the terminal font to MesloNF 'Regular'.
4. Set your color theme of choice -- _I like Solarized Dark, Nord, and Gruvbox!_
5. Source zsh with the following command: `zsh`
6. (Optional) Change your default/login shell to zsh: `sudo chsh -s $(which zsh)`
7. Enjoy
